This episode I have a conversation with Bonita re: [Orgasm Statistics](https://pleasurebetter.com/orgasm-statistics/)

If you're new to the show you might want to brush up and check out an early episode [Theory of 100](https://anchor.fm/sucias/episodes/Theory-of-100--Or-how-to-tell-if-a-male-might-be-any-good-in-the-sack-and-other-useless-things-epp04s) where I lay the groundwork and essentially give an unscientific version of today's episode. Although the website surprised me with a few facts towards the end.
