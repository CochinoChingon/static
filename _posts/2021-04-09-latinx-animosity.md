Another episode, this time I'm talking about animosity I've noticed over the years that I hadn't paid attention to, until I spoke on a friends podcast.
I recorded on my end, so you'll hear what sounds like two episodes… or not, if I did the job right. And of course who is even bothering to read this? Anywho, enjoy
